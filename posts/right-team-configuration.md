Our company has been rather fortunate in the last year, given all the world events. We've seen confident, measured stewardship from our founders and senior leadership that have meant we're actually growing our team when other businesses have had to let people go. Having brought two new developers on at the start of this year, I had to make some decisions around what the best approach to delivering our product in a sustained way would be.

## Outcomes vs Structures

> Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure - Conway's Law

It's still very common to see technology teams built around the architecture of the product: front-end teams building UI and features, back-end teams handling the infrastructure and low-level business logic. Those teams make sense on the face of it, but become hard to scale in ways that allow cross-functional collaboration and flow of ideas and effort.
