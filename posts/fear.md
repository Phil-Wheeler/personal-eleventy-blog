Imposter syndrome is talked about (or at least referenced) in the technology sector regularly. I see a lot written about it in tweets, blog posts or in conference talks. And rightly so. It's absolutely a thing. But as we advance in our careers and gain the experience and wisdom that the years in the industry bring, it goes away as we learn to manage it. Right?

I think the perception of more senior leaders and managers is that they have fought the imposter syndrome dragon and defeated it in an epic battle of will and strength. My experience is... not that. Self-doubt or second-guessing decisions doesn't just magically go away. There are often times when I feel like I'm out of my depth or lack the credentials for the role I'm in. I have team members who feel anxiety that they're not ready for additional responsibility or feel overwhelmed by the prospect of delegating work they were previously responsible for in order to take on new tasks they have no experience with.

If you're reading this, there's a good chance you'll have your own experiences of these sorts of situations. I can confidently tell you: it's not just you; it will work out fine with the right support.

## Check your reality

A big part of arresting self-doubt is understanding the objective facts of how you got where you are and what you're currently tasked with capably doing. Confidence comes from repeatable results.
