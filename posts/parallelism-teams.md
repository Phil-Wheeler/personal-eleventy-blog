You don't want to just throw money at a problem and hope it works without understanding what the likely outcome is expected to be. But in a SaaS product company, what is that ROI based on and how do you demonstrate a projected change in productivity or speed of delivery?

Before we get into exploring actual measures or metrics, let's all agree that software is complicated. Also, so are people. People _writing_ software is **very** complicated. Software involves a lot of "it depends". "How long will this feature take to finish?": it depends. "Can we get the software to do this thing?": it depends.
